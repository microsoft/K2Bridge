# Update K2bridge (Elasticsearch)

As part of the K2Bridge implementation, a small [internal Elasticsearch instance](https://github.com/microsoft/K2Bridge#how-does-it-work) is being used to service Kibana's metadata-related requests (index-patterns, saved queries etc.).

Following [Elasticsearch's announcement](https://www.elastic.co/blog/new-elasticsearch-and-logstash-releases-upgrade-apache-log4j2), we have updated the underlying Elasticsearch to version 6.8.22, which is the latest recommended version by Elastic, we recommend updating the K2Bridge deployment. 

To upgrade K2Bridge's underlying Elasticsearch, run:
```bash
$ helm upgrade <helm release name> <chart location> --reuse-values -n <k8s namespace> --set elasticsearch.imageTag=6.8.22
```

Example:

```bash
helm upgrade k2bridge . --reuse-values -n myk2bridge --set elasticsearch.imageTag=6.8.22
```
